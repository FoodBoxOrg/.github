## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our Symfony project, please do not disclose it publicly. Instead, report it to us by following these steps:

1. Send an email to us with the subject "Security Issue: [Brief Description]".
2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce.
3. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and work on a fix.
4. A patch will be released as soon as possible, and you will be credited if desired.

### Security Best Practices

To keep your Symfony application secure:

- Keep all dependencies up to date (`composer update`).
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.
- Regularly audit your code and third-party packages.
- Enforce HTTPS and proper session security.
